AppKey ANE for Adobe AIR projects

Finished ANE ready for download: github.com/appkey/AIR/ANE/AppKeyExtension.ane

The approach to the AppKey ANE roughly follows the Adobe Android ANE tutorial.
Setting up a proper FlashBuilder environment is as tricky as building the ANE itself.
Instructions for a basic ANE & build environment setup can be found here:
